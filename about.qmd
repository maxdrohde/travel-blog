Welcome to my travel blog. I document the places I visit through photos and short stories.

I started this blog as a way to organize my photos after trips — somewhere between a personal
archive and a postcard to friends. Most of the posts are heavy on images and light on words,
though sometimes a place deserves more than a caption.

I travel slowly when I can. A week in one city beats three days in three cities. I like
walking without a map, eating where the locals eat, and staying long enough to have a
favorite coffee shop. The best moments are usually unplanned — a wrong turn that leads to
a viewpoint, a conversation with a stranger at a bar, the light doing something unexpected
at the end of the day.

The photos here are all shot on whatever I had with me — sometimes a proper camera, sometimes
just a phone. I'm not a photographer in any serious sense, but I try to capture what a place
felt like, not just what it looked like.

Feel free to check out the latest trips on the [home page](index.qmd).
