A companion to the [Photo Grid Demo](../photo-grid-demo/index.qmd), covering everything
else: wide photos, lightbox features, typography, tables, callouts, columns, and more.

## Wide Photo

The `.photo-wide` class shows a single image at full content width with a max height of
500px. Good for hero-style shots within a post.

::: {.photo-wide}

:::

## Lightbox Groups

All images on this site open in a lightbox when clicked. The `group` attribute links
images into a shared gallery so you can arrow between them. Different `group` values
create separate galleries on the same page.

The `description` attribute adds a caption in the lightbox overlay — visible when you
click any image on this page.

## Typography

### Headings

H1 is reserved for the page title. Here are H2 through H6, all in IBM Plex Sans bold.
To avoid breaking the page structure, these are shown as text samples rather than actual
headings:

::: {style="padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 3px solid #ddd;"}
[Heading 2]{style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700; display: block; margin: 0.8rem 0;"}

[Heading 3]{style="font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 700; display: block; margin: 0.8rem 0;"}

[Heading 4]{style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-weight: 700; display: block; margin: 0.8rem 0;"}

[Heading 5]{style="font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 700; display: block; margin: 0.8rem 0;"}

[Heading 6]{style="font-size: 0.9rem; font-weight: 700; display: block; margin: 0.8rem 0;"}
:::

### Inline Formatting

| Syntax | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `**bold**` | **bold** |
| `*italic*` | *italic* |
| `***bold italic***` | ***bold italic*** |
| `~~strikethrough~~` | ~~strikethrough~~ |
| `^superscript^` | ^superscript^ |
| `~subscript~` | ~subscript~ |
| `` `inline code` `` | `inline code` |
| `[link text](url)` | [link text](https://example.com) |

## Blockquotes

> The city was better than any photo of it. We walked until our feet gave out, ate whatever
> looked good, and tried not to think about the flight home.

Nested blockquote:

> Someone once told me that the best trips are the ones where you throw away the itinerary.
>
> > I think they were right.

## Tables

| City | Season | Days | Highlight |
|------|--------|------|-----------|
| Paris | Winter | 7 | Seine at sunset |
| Tokyo | Spring | 14 | Cherry blossoms at Meguro River |
| Kyoto | Autumn | 5 | Fushimi Inari at dawn |
| Lisbon | Summer | 4 | Tram 28 through Alfama |

## Code Blocks

Inline: use `quarto render` to build the site.

Fenced block with syntax highlighting:

```yaml
# _quarto.yml excerpt
format:
  html:
    theme:
      - default
      - moving.scss
    css: styles.css
    lightbox: true
```

```css
/* Column modifier — 3 columns */
.photo-grid.cols-3 {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```

## Callouts

::: {.callout-note}
## Packing tip
Roll your clothes instead of folding them. You'll fit more and wrinkle less.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Golden hour
The best light for photos is in the first hour after sunrise and the last hour before
sunset. Plan your walks accordingly.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Cherry blossom timing
Peak bloom in Tokyo varies by 2-3 weeks year to year. Don't book flights until the
forecast narrows down in early March.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Visa requirements
Check entry requirements well before your trip. Some countries require applications
weeks in advance.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Collapsible callout
Click to expand. This is useful for long asides that would interrupt the flow of a post.
You can put anything in here — text, images, code, tables.
:::

## Columns

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Left column** — useful for placing text alongside an image, comparing two photos, or
breaking up a wall of text. Columns stack vertically on mobile.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![Ramen](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557872943-16a5ac26437e?w=400){group="cols" description="Tonkotsu ramen."}
:::
::::

Uneven split (30/70):

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="30%"}
**Narrow sidebar.** Good for captions, metadata, or short annotations next to a
larger block of content.
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
The wider column carries the main content. This layout works well when you want to
annotate a photo or add context without taking up a full row. The asymmetry draws the
eye to the larger side.
:::
::::

## Tabsets

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Morning

Coffee at the hotel, then a long walk through quiet residential streets before the
crowds wake up. Best time for photos — soft light, empty sidewalks.

## Afternoon

Museums, markets, or just sitting in a park. This is when jet lag catches up. A nap
is not defeat; it's strategy.

## Evening

Find somewhere to eat. No reservations, just walk until something looks right. The
best meals on every trip have been unplanned.
:::

## Lists

Unordered:

- Pack light — one bag, carry-on only
- Learn three phrases in the local language
- Leave room for getting lost
  - Literally (wrong turns lead to discoveries)
  - Figuratively (skip the itinerary sometimes)

Ordered:

1. Book flights
2. Find a place to stay
3. Make a loose list of neighborhoods to explore
4. Throw away the list on day two

Definition list:

Hanami
: The Japanese tradition of enjoying the beauty of cherry blossoms. Usually involves
  sitting under the trees with food and drink.

Bouquinistes
: The open-air booksellers along the banks of the Seine in Paris. Their green metal
  boxes have been there since the 16th century.

Konbini
: Japanese convenience stores (7-Eleven, Lawson, FamilyMart). Far better than the
  name suggests — fresh onigiri, good coffee, usable ATMs.

## Footnotes

The Meguro River walk is roughly 3.8 km from Ikejiri-Ohashi to Meguro station[^1].
The best section for photos is the middle third, between Nakameguro and the highway
overpass[^2].

[^1]: You can start from either end. The Nakameguro station entrance drops you right
      into the densest stretch of trees.

[^2]: Arrive before 7 AM if you want photos without crowds. By 10 AM the path is
      shoulder-to-shoulder.

## Horizontal Rule

Content above the rule.

* * *

Content below the rule. Use `* * *` in Quarto — not `---`, which is interpreted as
a YAML delimiter.

## Math

Inline math: the focal length and aperture relationship is $N = f / D$ where $N$ is the
f-number, $f$ is focal length, and $D$ is the entrance pupil diameter.

Display math:

$$
\text{Exposure Value} = \log_2\!\left(\frac{N^2}{t}\right)
$$

where $N$ is the f-number and $t$ is exposure time in seconds.
