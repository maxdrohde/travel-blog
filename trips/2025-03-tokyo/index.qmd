Timing a trip to Tokyo for cherry blossom season is a gamble, but this year it paid off.
The city was draped in pink and white for nearly the entire visit. We had two full weeks,
which felt luxurious — enough time to settle into a rhythm instead of rushing between
landmarks. Wake up early, grab an onigiri from the conbini downstairs, ride the train
somewhere new.

What surprised me most was how quiet Tokyo can be. Step one block off a main road and you're
in a residential neighborhood where the only sound is a bicycle bell and someone's wind chime.
The contrast with Shibuya or Shinjuku is surreal. It's like the city has a volume knob and
every alley is a different setting.

We ate extraordinarily well without ever spending much. A bowl of ramen for 900 yen that would
cost forty dollars anywhere else. Sushi at a standing counter in Tsukiji where the chef sliced
the fish to order. Yakitori under the train tracks in Yurakucho, smoke and laughter and tiny
glasses of beer.

## Sakura Highlights

The Meguro River is one of the most popular hanami spots, and for good reason.
The branches arch over the water creating a tunnel of blossoms. We went twice — once in the
afternoon when it was packed with families on blue tarps sharing bento boxes and cans of
Asahi, and once at dawn when we had the path almost to ourselves. Both were perfect in
completely different ways.

Shinjuku Gyoen was the other standout. The park has an entire section of late-blooming cherry
trees that peak a few days after the rest of the city, so even at the end of our trip there
were still fresh blossoms to sit under. We spread out a blanket, opened some convenience store
sandwiches, and stayed for hours watching petals drift down like slow snow.
